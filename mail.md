**Subject:** Internship Project Assignment - ERP Notification System - Cahier de Charges Attached  

**Dear [Intern's Name],**  

I hope this email finds you well.  

Please find attached the **cahier de charges (project specification)** for your upcoming internship project. The document outlines the scope, objectives, technical requirements, and timeline for the **ERP Intelligent Notification & Alert Management System** project.  

This project will involve developing a web-based system that allows clients to create and customize notifications for various ERP modules (Stock, CRM, Facturation, GMAO, GPAO, RH, etc.). Key focus areas include:  
- A user-friendly interface for configuring alerts  
- Secure integration with ERP modules  
- Real-time notification delivery via email and in-app alerts  
- Ensuring **data confidentiality** (all processing remains within the client’s environment)  

Please review the attached document carefully. We will discuss it in detail during our kickoff meeting scheduled for **[Date & Time]**. In the meantime, if you have any initial questions or require clarifications, feel free to reach out.  

We are excited to have you on board and look forward to your contributions!  

Best regards,
